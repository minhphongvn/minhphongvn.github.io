This site is based on the [jekyllDecent](http://jwillmer.github.io/jekyllDecent) theme by Jens Willmer.
The header navigation and idea of social icons were taken from modified segments of [http://willkoehler.net](http://willkoehler.net) by Will Koehler. [His blog](http://willkoehler.net/2014/08/26/save-50-hours-setting-up-your-jekyll-blog.html) is helpful too.

I recently completed my master's degree in Theoretical Physics at The University of Edinburgh 
with a focus on quantum field theory and lattice field theory. 
I spend most of my time right now coding or doing maths, although blog entries will be quite
code-heavy for a while !

**key languages** `python` `mathematica` `Fortran` `VBA`\\
**hacky languages** `C++` `C` `SQL` `bash` `regex` `xpath` `css` `html`

 - Further develop Hybrid Monte Carlo library `python`
 - Basic algo. trading models: $\mu$ revert, tech. analysis, $\sigma$ target `python`
 - Autocorrelations in Generalised Hybrid Monte Carlo (HMC) `python` `Mathematica` `C++`
 - Basic algo. trading models: momentum, historic pattern recognition `python`
 - Web Scraping: recursive crawlers, PDF parsing, custom APIs `python` `SQL` `regex` `xpath`

## Random
I drink lots of coffee but don't really like it. Top speed on a snowboard is just under 80mph. I set my tabs to four spaces. Favourite beer is Guinness.

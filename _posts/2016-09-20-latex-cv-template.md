This is very short post to share what I think it a brilliant $\LaTeX$ template for a CV written by Michael DeCorte. I have no idea where I got it from but it served me well in many a job application.

The whole thing is rather self-explanatory. This blog entry is not to teach $\LaTeX$. There are far better guides than I could ever write on that topic. [^1]

# Required Files

 - Style class [`res.cls`]({{ site.baseurl }}/media/2016-09-20-latex-cv-template/res.cls)
 - The CV template [`cv.tex`]({{ site.baseurl }}/media/2016-09-20-latex-cv-template/cv.tex)

# Usage
The simplest way to use this template is to ensure that `res.cls` and `cv.tex` are in the same directory and then just remember to swap out **all** my details for yours.

   <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/media/2016-09-20-latex-cv-template/latex-cv-img.png"/>
   <figcaption>The compiled result. I blurred it so that the content doesn't distract from the layout.</figcaption>
